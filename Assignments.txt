Homework Day 1 -- Enhance the user create and get methods.
===============

1. Update the UserResource.createUser method to return a FORBIDDEN status code if a duplicate user exists. 
	Continue to return 201 (CREATED) if the user does not exist already.

2. Create a GET method to return a user by user name. Return OK (200) if the user exists and a NOT_FOUND (404) 
	if the user does not exist.

3. Create test case methods steps 1 and 2.  Checking for status code is enough at this point as we have not
	covered working with user representations yet.
