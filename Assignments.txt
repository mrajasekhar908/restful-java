End of class and Homework Day 2 Assignment
=============================

Using the chirp.resources.PostResource class

1. Create an @POST createPost method that also creates the timestamp for the post

2. Create an @GET getPost method based on the path /posts/{username}/{timestamp}
	
3. Create an @GET getPosts method for a username -- returns a collection of posts.

4. If you encounter a circular reference, ignore a field to avoid --  this will be address on Day 3
	
5. Create test cases for 1 and 2. 3 is a bonus. Test using the interactive Server and POSTMan first.  

Homework Day 1 -- Enhance the user create and get methods.
===============

1. Update the UserResource.createUser method to return a FORBIDDEN status code if a duplicate user exists. 
	Continue to return 201 (CREATED) if the user does not exist already.

2. Create a GET method to return a user by user name. Return OK (200) if the user exists and a NOT_FOUND (404) 
	if the user does not exist.

3. Create test case methods steps 1 and 2.  Checking for status code is enough at this point as we have not
	covered working with user representations yet.
